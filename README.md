British Columbia 2009 voting / non-voting patterns

This repository contains the data and R code necessary to create two charts used in the BC Stats report 
"Who Heads to the Polls? Exploring the Demographics of Voters in British Columbia" (March 2010)
http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/stats/Who-heads-to-the-polls.pdf

The charts are the pattern of voting behaviour charts shown on pages iii and 15 (the 5th and 17th PDF pages) of the report.
